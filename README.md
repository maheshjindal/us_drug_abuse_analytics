# USA Drug Abuse Analytics

This project focuses on the Data Analysis of the DRUG ABUSE BEHAVIOUR OVER UNITED STATES using real-world datasets. We tend to analyse the use of drugs over various regions and the various factors impacting the change in drug consumption use over the years. To achieve this goal we have used multiple massive datasets from the multiple legitimate data sources published by US Government.


## Description
While working on the data analytics, we focus to answer the following questions:
- What is the drug consumption behaviour over different regions in the united states? 
- What demographic factors are involved which lead to the rise of this problem? 
- What are the several factors of human personal development eg. Education, Source of Income etc. which might be the indirect factors impacting on this problem?
