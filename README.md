# USA Drug Abuse Analytics


## Description
The goal of this project is to analyse the drug abuse behavior over United States. While working on the data analytics, we focus to answer the following questions:
1. What are the drug trends and variants available and how have they been shifted over the past few years?
2. What demographics were affected the most by drug abuse and the reason behind them?
3. How has drug abuse impacted peopleâ€™s health and lives over the years? What is the mortality due to drug overdose?
4. What are the different protective measures taken to prevent drug abuse in the future?
