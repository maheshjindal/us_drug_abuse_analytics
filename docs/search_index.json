We tend to analyse the use of drugs over various regions and the various factors impacting the change in drug consumption use over the years. To achieve this goal we have used multiple massive datasets from the multiple legitimate data sources published by US Government. The use of drugs is pernicious to humans with respect to the health and society. It can harm brain and body, sometimes permanently. It can hurt the people in the surroundings including friends, families, kids, and unborn babies. Drug use can also lead to addiction. Due to substancial increase in drug consumption, its very important to analyse the factors leading to this situation as abating down this problem could help in reducing distress among people, improving their health and lives in the future. We are targetting to focus on the following concern areas * What is the drug consumption behaviour over different regions in the united states? * What demographic factors are involved which lead to the rise of this problem? * What are the several factors of human personal development eg. Education, Source of Income etc. which might be the indirect factors impacting on this problem? While working on this project, we have followed a general Exploratory Data Analysis Paradigm i.e: 1. Data Extraction 2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning 3. Data Analyzation (Including Static and Interactive Components) 4.

This data was published by the U.S. department of Health &amp; Human services and can be found under Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Data Archive. It contains data about people admitted to hospitals in various states due to alcohol/drug overdose. This data serves as a good proxy to understand the underlying trends of drug abuse. https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010/2010-eval-estimates/sc-est2010-alldata5.csv. This data was published by the United states census Bureau. This contains information about each states population across various dimensions such as age, gender, race. The data is from 2000 to 2010. https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010/2010-eval-estimates/sc-est2010-alldata5.csv. This data was published by the United states census Bureau. This contains information about each states population across various dimensions such as age, gender, race. The data is from 2010 to 2020. We looked and explored for other data sources as well. There is no source which provides well documents Drug abuse trends directly. There are two other notable data sources which are: Monitoring the Futures Survey data (https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NAHDAP/series/35). This survey was designed to explore changes in important values, behaviors, and lifestyle orientations of contemporary American youth. The surveys began in 1975 with 12th-grade students only. Eighth- and 10th-grade student surveys were added in 1991. It is an ongoing survey. Issue: The data in this dataset were in form of 3000 questions. Each question was represented by a column in the dataset. As we had limited span, we could not use this as our dataset as we would have to undersatnd all the 3000 questions to make use of this dataset. CDC (Center for Disease Control) Underlying causes of death data (https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D76). Issue: This data did not have a lot of variables and we would not be able to understand the underlying trends between demographics and drug abuse. 2.2 Data Description All the data collected was given in the csv format. The treatment dataset initially contained 37558015 rows and 62 columns. After the preprocessing it got reduced to 9493737 rows and 14 columns. The data transformations done to achieve this can be found here. The data dictionary along with an understanding of variables can be found here. The combined population data contained 394740 rows and 21 columns. The data dictionary along with an understanding of variables can be found here. 2.3 Issues with the data The treatment data does not contain data about all admissions. It is a huge dataset and is meant to be used to understand the characteristics of the substance abuse, form hypothesis and understand the underlying trends. Some of the data have missing values. But fortunately due to abundance of data, we can ignore these rows and move ahead with rows that have data. Though, this strategy does not work for columns with huge amount of missing data and these are kept as it is in our analysis. Because the size is data is enormous, it takes a lot of time to preprocess the data. We cannot directly work with delimited data but had to convert file to feather format to ensure quick reading and writing of files. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Treatment data 3.2 Population data", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Treatment data The treatment dataset initially contained 37558015 rows and 62 columns. Steps followed for cleaning the Treatment data: There are too many variables recorded in the dataset. We picked a few important ones for our analysis. We chose 12 important variables. They are: ‘AGE’, ‘ADMYR’ (Year), ‘GENDER’, ‘RACE’, ‘EDUC’ (Education),‘EMPLOY’ (Employment Status), ‘STFIPS’ (States), ‘REGION’, ‘DIVISION’,‘SERVICES’ (Treatment), ‘SUB1’ (Substance consumed), ‘ROUTE1’ (How it was consumed), ‘FREQ1’ (Frequency of consumption). According to data dictionary, the values in each column represnted something so for each variable we transformed the data to the original meaning by creating and using the following json. _ AGE -&gt; “1”: “12–14”, “2”: “15–17”, “3”: “18–20”,“4”: “21–24”, “5”: “25–29”, “6”: “30–34”, “7”: “35–39”, “8”: “40–44”, “9”: “45–49”, “10”: “50–54”, “11”: “55–64”, “12”: “65+” ADMYR -&gt; “2000”,“2001”,“2002”,“2003”,“2004”, “2005”, “2006”, “2007”, “2008”, “2009”, “2010”, “2011”, “2012”, “2013”, “2014”, “2015”, “2016”, “2017”, “2018”, “2019” GENDER -&gt; “1”: “Male”,“2”: “Female”, “-9”: “Missing” RACE -&gt; “1”: “Alaska Native”,“2”: “American Indian”,“3”: “Asian or Pacific Islander”,“4”: “Black or African American”,“5”: “White”,“6”: “Asian”,“7”: “Other single race”,“8”: “Two or more races”,“9”: “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander”,“-9”: “Missing” EDUC -&gt; “1”: “Less than one school grade, no schooling, nursery school, or kindergarten to Grade 8”,“2”: “Grades 9 to 11”,“3”: “Grade 12”,“4”: “1-3 years of college”,“5”: “4 years of college”,“-9”: “Missing” EMPLOY -&gt; “1”: “Full-time”,“2”: “Part-time”,“3”: “Unemployed”,“4”: “Not in labor force”,“-9”: “Missing” STFIPS -&gt; “1”: “Alabama”,“2”: “Alaska”,“4”: “Arizona”,“5”: “Arkansas”,“6”: “California”,“8”: “Colorado”,“9”: “Connecticut”,“10”: “Delaware”,“11”: “District of Columbia”,“12”: “Florida”,“13”: “Georgia”,“15”: “Hawaii”,“16”: “Idaho”,“17”: “Illinois”,“18”: “Indiana”,“19”: “Iowa”,“20”: “Kansas”,“21”: “Kentucky”,“22”: “Louisiana”,“23”: “Maine”,“24”: “Maryland”,“25”: “Massachusetts”,“26”: “Michigan”,“27”: “Minnesota”,“28”: “Mississippi”,“29”: “Missouri”,“30”: “Montana”,“31”: “Nebraska”,“32”: “Nevada”,“33”: “New Hampshire”,“34”: “New Jersey”,“35”: “New Mexico”,“36”: “New York”,“37”: “North Carolina”,“38”: “North Dakota”,“39”: “Ohio”,“40”: “Oklahoma”,“41”: “Oregon”,“42”: “Pennsylvania”,“44”: “Rhode Island”,“45”: “South Carolina”,“46”: “South Dakota”,“47”: “Tennessee”,“48”: “Texas”,“49”: “Utah”,“50”: “Vermont”,“51”: “Virginia”,“53”: “Washington”,“54”: “West Virginia”,“55”: “Wisconsin”,“56”: “Wyoming”,“72”: “Puerto Rico” REGION -&gt; “0”: “U.S. territories”,“1”: “Northeast”,“2”: “Midwest”,“3”: “South”,“4”: “West” DIVISION -&gt; “0”: “U.S. territories”,“1”: “New England”,“2”: “Middle Atlantic”,“3”: “East North Central”,“4”: “West North Central”,“5”: “South Atlantic”,“6”: “East South Central”,“7”: “West South Central”,“8”: “Mountain”,“9”: “Pacific” SERVICES -&gt; “1”: “Detox, 24-hour, hospital inpatient”,“2”: “Detox, 24-hour, free-standing residential”,“3”: “Rehab/residential, hospital (non-detox)”,“4”: “Rehab/residential, short term (30 days or fewer)”,“5”: “Rehab/residential, long term (more than 30 days)”,“6”: “Ambulatory, intensive outpatient”,“7”: “Ambulatory, non-intensive outpatient”,“8”: “Ambulatory, detoxification” SUB1 -&gt; “1”: “None”,“2”: “Alcohol”,“3”: “Cocaine”,“4”: “Marijuana”,“5”: “Heroin”,“6”: “Non-prescription”,“7”: “Other opiates and synthetics”,“8”: “PCP”,“9”: “Hallucinogens”,“10”: “Methamphetamine”,“11”: “Other amphetamines”,“12”: “Other stimulants”,“13”: “Benzodiazepines”,“14”: “Other tranquilizers”,“15”: “Barbiturates”,“16”: “Other sedatives or hypnotics”,“17”: “Inhalants”,“18”: “Over-the-counter medications”,“19”: “Other drugs”,“-9”: “Missing” ROUTE1 -&gt; “1”: “Oral”,“2”: “Smoking”,“3”: “Inhalation”,“4”: “Injection”,“5”: “Other”,“-9”: “Missing” FREQ1 -&gt; “1”: “No use in the past month”,“2”: “Some use”,“3”: “Daily use”,“-9”: “Missing” “DETNLF” -&gt; “1”: “Homemaker”, “2”: “Student”, “3”: “Retired, disabled”, “4”: “Resident of institution”, “5”: “Other”, “-9”: “Missing” Important: The DETNLF column represents ‘Not in labour force’ rows of the EMPLOY column. To make lesser data and reduce redundant columns we replaced ‘Not in labour force’ of ‘EMPLOY’ column with this column values. As the data had ~37 Million records. It was necessary to reduce our scope of analysis to important categories for each variable. Imporatnce was decided based on the percentage of rows the category was present in. For example: The table above shows number of rows and percentage of rows for each substance. The top 5 substances that is Alcohol, Heroin, Marijuana, Cocaine and Methamphetamine account for 88.4% of data. So we are only going to consider these substances in our analysis. Similar logic have been followed for other columns. For each column the following categories are considered. 3.1. GENDER: “Male”: “1”, “Female”: “2” 3.2. EDUC: “Less than one school grade, no schooling, nursery school, or kindergarten to Grade 8”, “Grades 9 to 11”, “Grade 12”, “1-3 years of college”, “4 years of college” 3.3. REGION: “Northeast”, “Midwest”, “South”, “West” 3.4. ROUTE1: “Oral”,“Smoking”,“Inhalation”,“Injection” 3.5. FREQ1: “No use in the past month”, “Some use”, “Daily use” For all the other columns we consider all the data except DETNLF which is removed. For the RACE column we keep the ‘White’, ‘Black or African American’ rows, combine ‘American Indian’ and ‘Alaska Native’ together into ‘American Indian or Alaska Native Alone’ and put all the other RACES into ‘Others’. This was done because the other data source ‘population data’ had race in this format. To keep consistency across data sources this transformation was necessary. Now we group by all the columns, as the data has multiple rows with same characteristics. As each row represents an admission. So we will group by all the columns to get number of cases for each characteristic of admission. Now the dataset has 9493737 rows and 14 columns. 3.2 Population data Steps followed for cleaning the Population data: For population data 2010 to 2019. There are too many variables recorded in the dataset. We picked a few important ones for our analysis. We chose 17 important variables. They are: ‘AGE’, ‘SEX’, ‘RACE’,‘NAME’(States),‘REGION’,‘DIVISION’,‘POPESTIMATE2010’,‘POPESTIMATE2011’,‘POPESTIMATE2012’,‘POPESTIMATE2013’,‘POPESTIMATE2014’,‘POPESTIMATE2015’,‘POPESTIMATE2016’,‘POPESTIMATE2017’,‘POPESTIMATE2018’,‘POPESTIMATE2019’,‘ORIGIN’. Filter for Origin = 0 (Total) and then remove this column. As we will not be diving deep into population’s origin as this column is not present in treatment data. According to data dictionary, the values in each column represented something so for each variable we transformed the data to the original meaning by creating and using the following json. SEX -&gt; “0”: “Total”,“1”: “Male”,“2”: “Female” RACE -&gt; “1”: “White”,“2”: “Black or African American”,“3”: “American Indian or Alaska Native Alone”,“4”: “Asian”,“5”: “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander”,“6”: “Two or more races” REGION -&gt; “1”: “Northeast”,“2”: “Midwest”,“3”: “South”,“4”: “West” DIVISION -&gt; “1”: “New England”,“2”: “Middle Atlantic”,“3”: “East North Central”,“4”: “West North Central”,“5”: “South Atlantic”,“6”: “East South Central”,“7”: “West South Central”,“8”: “Mountain”,“9”: “Pacific” NAME -&gt; Name of each state AGE -&gt; numerical variable ranging from 0 to 85 POPESTIMATE2010 -&gt; Estimated population of 2010 POPESTIMATE2011 -&gt; Estimated population of 2011 POPESTIMATE2012 -&gt; Estimated population of 2012 POPESTIMATE2013 -&gt; Estimated population of 2013 POPESTIMATE2014 -&gt; Estimated population of 2014 POPESTIMATE2015 -&gt; Estimated population of 2015 POPESTIMATE2016 -&gt; Estimated population of 2016 POPESTIMATE2017 -&gt; Estimated population of 2017 POPESTIMATE2018 -&gt; Estimated population of 2018 POPESTIMATE2019 -&gt; Estimated population of 2019 Remove Sex = ‘Total’, as want to look at the subcategories male and female. Transform the Age variable (numerical) to age categories(categorical) as we have only got age categories in treatment data. Also, change the RACE variable categories to match the treatment dataset Race categories. Aggregate the data on these relevant columns. Pivot the table so that the different columns for population estimate for each year becomes can be represented by 2 columns - ‘Year’ and ‘Population estimate’ (pivot_longer) The above steps are also followed for the population dataset from 2001 to 2010. Append (Rbind) the two datasets to get a final population dataset. Also change the name of the following columns so as to match the treatment dataset: AGE_CATEGORY,SEX,Year,NAME to AGE,GENDER,ADMYR,STFIPS respectively.

For more details, see the data transformation section here. The following visualization gives information about missing data after the transformation: Observations: Only the Employment column seem to be missing values. About 10% of rows in the data seem to have missing value for this column. We feel 10% is a lot of data to be removed directly and it might still hold information. For example: The information is missing for a particular state or year etc. 4.2 Understanding missing values pattern Onservations: The Employment data was missing during the early 2000’s. The recent data has information about employment. The state of California account for 30% of the missing data. This is much larger than any other state.

Observations: There seems to be a sharp increase in the number of people admitted due to Heroin after 2010. On the other end, patients admitted due to alcohol and cocaine overdose seems to have decreased sharply after 2009 and 2006 respectively. Methamphetamine also seems to be on the rise, though the increase is not as sharp. We need to see what has to to an increase in the cases of Heroin &amp; Methamphetamine admission. Possible Hypothesis: People consuming alcohol or cocaine might be consuming heroin now. The demographics of the consumption might have changed over time. The expenses required for the hospital might have increased for alcohol and cocaine and people due to report it except in cases of emergency. ## Does the treatment due to substance abuse vary with region and year? Observations: The trend of admission to hospitals due to Heroin consumption has increased sharply for the Northeast and south region and increased steadly for the Midwest region. Surprisingly, for the West region, the trend seems to be constant/decreasing. Is the trend same across all states in the region? Is there a steady increase or there is some event that led to steap increase over the last few years? Is there a differences in the demographics of each region that expalins this variability? Admission due to Methamphetamine seems to on an increasing trend in South and Midwest. The trend is constant for the Northeast. Out of all the regions, the West region seems to be performing the best as the trend of all the drugs (including alcohol) seems to be decreasing over the years. What is the difference here? Is it demographics or policies adopted by government? Is it because there is less awareness and people don’t get admitted to hospital? 5.2 Which states in the North-east and South are contributing to the increasing trend of admissions due to Heroin Abuse? Observations: In the Northeast region, Massachusetts (MA) and Connecticut (CT) admission due to Heroin abuse have increased drastically over the years. Other states in the Northeast region namely New York, New Jersey, Vermont and Rhode Island have also seen an increase over the years. The entire region seems to be a concern area in terms of Heroin abuse. In the South region, Maryland and Delaware seems to have a sharp increase in the admission due to Heroin abuse. District of columbia also shows an increase but all the other states seem to be almost steady in their rate of admission. Are all these trends recent or the increase has been steady? 5.3 Is the increasing trend of heroin admission recent or has it consistently increased over the years for the concerning states? As the unnatural spikes in the trend of Maryland and Delaware, we might not be able to decipher trends in other states. So removing Maryland and Delware (outliers) to understand the trends better. Observations: For the South region, Maryland and Delaware show recent uprise in the admission trend from 2014 and 2016 respectively. It had been almost steady for both the states before. What event triggered this sudden increase in admission? Was there increase in Heroin Abuse or the awareness of people regrading the treatment increased? For the District of columbia (DC), there was a sudden spike at 2007 but post that it has been steady. As this state is close to Maryland and Delaware, is it possible that the spikes in the three states are correrealted? Almost all states in the north east are increasing steadily over time. In general the increase for most states became more sharp post 2009-10. In the midwest the state of Michigan has been steadly increasing over time while in the west the state of Colorado sees a steady increase. Are the state governments of these respective states taking adequate steps to mitigate this trend? 5.4 Does gender play a role in admission due to heroin abuse in the South region? Observations: We had already identified that Maryland and Delaware show an unusual steap increase in the admission of Heroin abuse patients. Here, we see that the male and female do not increase in proportion over the years. Both Maryland and Delaware see a sharp increase over the years. But in case of Maryland,the proportion of admission increased for both males and females from 2016 to 2017 but from 2017 to 2018 the increase is male admissions is much more. Is there any underline reason behind this or is it a data anomaly? For Delaware, both females and males seem to be increasing in the same proportion. For all the other states, there is no shift in the proportion of male and female admissions over the years. 5.5 Does age play a role in admission due to heroin abuse in the South region? Observations: District of Columbia(DC) shows an unusual trend. Unlike other states in the South region, DC has much more admissions from people belonging to higher age group. Why is there such a trend? Is it because the people who have retired are consuming more drugs? There is no other apparent insight for other state and they all seem to behave similarly in terms of age group and admissions. 5.6 Does employment play a role in admission due to Substance abuse? We picked “District of Columbia”,“Colorado”,“Delaware” and “Maryland” beacuse District of Columbia”,“Delaware” and “Maryland” are concerning areas with increasing Heroin trends. Observations: Students in general are consuming more Marijuana as compared to other people. Retired people and unemployed people in the District of Columbia are consuming more drugs (including Heroin) as compared to other states with the same popualtion (Retired and unemployed). More unemployed people in Colorado are getting admitted due to Cocaine and Heroin as compared to other states with the same population (Unemployed). 5.7 Does race play a role in the admission due to heroin abuse in the South region? Obseravtions: There are very unusual trends here. It should be noted that Delaware and Maryland are neigbouring states and the recent increase in the admissions is very different for the White and Black population. Admissions due to Black population have spiked a lot in Maryland, but it did not spike much in Delaware. The admission of white population due to Heroin have increased in both Delaware and Maryland. For district of Columbia, there is an increase in the admission of only Black population. There has not been increase in the admissions due to Heroin abuse for American Indians or Alaskan Native Population. West Virginia seems to have an increasing admission rate due to Heroin abuse for populations excluding White, Black, American Indian and Alaskan Native(Others). Except for American Indians and Alaskan natives, the city of Delevere seems to have increasing admission rate for Heroin abuse in the recent years.

This extensive data which includes demographic variables like Age, Gender, Race etc help us understand the correlations between these identities and the substance abuse. Our analysis follows a top-down approach, we start with the broader and more general questions like: What is the trend of the admission due to the different drugs in different region to more specific question like Is employment status of people contributing to the increasing Heroin admission in the District of Columbia. The analysis is an attempt to understand these complex questions, dive-deep and form hypothesis which can then be tested and some conclusions can be made. The process is exhaustive and includes steps for data preprocessing, data transformation, missing value analyisis and static and interactive visualizations for the constructed questions. For each visualization, observations and our hypothesis for such observations have also been included. Some of the key observations we made regarding the admissions trends: Region level: There seems to be a sharp increase in the number of people admitted due to Heroin after 2010. On the other end, patients admitted due to alcohol and cocaine overdose seems to have decreased sharply after 2009 and 2006 respectively. The trend of admission to hospitals due to Heroin consumption has increased sharply for the Northeast and south region and increased steadly for the Midwest region. Surprisingly, for the West region, the trend seems to be constant/decreasing. State level: In the Northeast region, Massachusetts (MA) and Connecticut (CT) admission due to Heroin abuse have increased drastically over the years. In the South region, Maryland and Delaware seems to have a sharp increase in the admission due to Heroin abuse. District of columbia also shows an increase but all the other states seem to be almost steady in their rate of admission. Almost all states in the north east are increasing steadily over time. In general the increase for most states became more sharp post 2009-10. For the South region, Maryland and Delaware show recent uprise in the admission trend from 2014 and 2016 respectively. It had been almost steady for both the states before. Southern States for Heroin: In terms of gender, both Maryland and Delaware see a sharp increase over the years. But in case of Maryland,the proportion of admission increased for both males and females from 2016 to 2017 but from 2017 to 2018 the increase is male admissions is much more. District of Columbia(DC) shows an unusual trend. Unlike other states in the South region, DC has much more admissions from people belonging to higher age group. Retired people and unemployed people in the District of Columbia are consuming more drugs (including Heroin) as compared to other states with the same popualtion (Retired and unemployed). In terms of Race, There are very unusual trends in the neigbouring states of Delaware and Maryland and the recent increase in the admissions is very different for the White and Black population in the two states. Admissions due to Black population have spiked a lot in Maryland, but it did not spike much in Delaware. On the other end, admission of white population due to Heroin have increased in both Delaware and Maryland. 7.2 Limitations Because of the huge dataset ~37 Million rows, it is impossible to look at the complete data. It requires some pre processing which leads to some loss of the original data. We cannot directly correlate the admission trends with the consumption trends because these variables might be related by other xogenous variables. We can form an hypothesis though that the increasing admission trend imply increasing consumption trend. The treatment data does not contain data about all admissions. It is a huge dataset and is meant to be used to understand the characteristics of the substance abuse, form hypothesis and understand the underlying trends. 7.3 Future Work Due to limited amount of time, our analysis mostly focuses on Heroin admission trends and certain number of demographic and human personal development indicators. We can look at other drugs as well as other variables that might expalin some of the underlying trends about the admissions. We can look at the other data sources mentioned in the data sources section here. These might help us understand the health issues, overall trends and behavioral change among teenagers (Monitoring the Futures). We can look at possible remidial steps being taken be the government to mitigate the crisis and correlate it with our analysis to understand if the steps could really benefit and mitigate this crisis. For example, if unemployment and drug abuse have direct correlation, the best way to tackle this crisis is to generate employment for youth.
